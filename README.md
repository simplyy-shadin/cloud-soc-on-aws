Ever wondered what it really takes to build a full-fledged **Security Operations Center (SOC)** — not just a theory lab, but a working environment that detects, analyzes, and responds to real threats?

That was exactly what I wanted to do. As a cybersecurity student, I wanted to go beyond "reading" about detection and response — I wanted to **see it happen**. So I took the challenge:

🚀 **Build my own Cloud-based SOC on AWS from scratch.**

This post walks you through every phase of that journey — from architecture design to automation — showing how I turned a set of EC2 instances into a live, functional detection-and-response environment.

## 🧠 Why I Wanted to Build It
Learning cybersecurity is one thing. But seeing how attacks are detected, correlated, and responded to in real time? That’s a different level.

In a corporate SOC, multiple tools work together — EDR, IDS, SIEM, SOAR, WAF, and more. I wanted to simulate that in a way where I could:
* **Understand** how data flows between systems.
* **See** how alerts get triggered.
* And finally, **automate** what a real SOC analyst would do.

This was my playground to connect all the puzzle pieces.

---

## ☁️ Phase 1: Setting up the Cloud Infrastructure
I started on **AWS** because it gave me flexibility, scalability, and easy networking between instances.

I deployed **five EC2 instances** using `t3.large` instance types, each serving a specific role in the SOC architecture:

| Instance          | Purpose                                                     |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wazuh-manager`   | The brain — collects logs and runs detection rules.         |
| `wazuh-agent-1`   | A vulnerable host running DVWA for attack simulation.       |
| `suricata-ids`    | Network-level intrusion detection system.                   |
| `nginx-proxy`     | Reverse proxy + ModSecurity for web app protection.         |
| `windows-server`  | Windows environment integrated with Elastic Agent for endpoint visibility. |

Every instance had **Wazuh Agent** installed (except the manager), forwarding logs to the Wazuh Manager.

**Networking** was configured so I could simulate real attacks — SSH brute force, web exploits, SQLi — and trace them through my SOC pipeline.

---

## 🔍 Phase 2: Integrating Detection Layers
A strong SOC depends on **visibility**. So I started layering detection from both **network** and **endpoint** perspectives.

### 🧱 Suricata IDS (Network Layer)
* Deployed on the `suricata-ids` instance.
* Operated in IDS mode to **monitor mirrored traffic**.
* Used custom rule sets for SSH brute force, port scans, and HTTP anomalies.
* Each alert generated by Suricata was forwarded to the **Wazuh Manager**, where it got enriched with host-level context.

This meant that when a network attack occurred, I could see **which host** was targeted and **what process** responded.

### 💡 Wazuh (Host Layer + SIEM)
Wazuh was my **central SIEM and detection engine**.

I created custom rules — like triggering an alert when **five consecutive SSH login failures** occurred within a minute.

Wazuh also ingested logs from:
* Nginx (reverse proxy logs)
* ModSecurity (web attack events)
* Suricata (network alerts)
* System logs (`auth.log`, `syslog`, etc.)

This combination gave me **end-to-end visibility** across layers.

---

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Automating Incident Response
Detection is cool. But **response** is what separates a SOC from a log collector.

Here’s how I took automation to the next level:

### 🧩 Lambda + WAF + Security Groups
When a Wazuh alert detected a **brute-force attack**, it triggered an **AWS Lambda function** that:
* Extracted the attacker’s IP.
* Blocked it automatically in both:
    * AWS **WAF**, and
    * AWS **Security Groups** (network-level firewall).
 
      **NOTE Lambda function:** The full Lambda implementation is available in the `lambda` branch — please check that branch for the complete code.


This made my SOC capable of **real-time mitigation** — the moment an attacker crossed the line, AWS itself shut them down.

---

## 🤖 Phase 4: Adding SOAR Automation with Shuffle
To take it further, I integrated **Shuffle SOAR** — an open-source automation platform.

When Wazuh generated an alert:
1.  It was sent to a **Shuffle webhook**.
2.  Shuffle ran a playbook that:
    * Queried **VirusTotal** for IP reputation.
    * Classified the severity (e.g., “Critical” if VirusTotal showed multiple detections).
    * Sent an **email notification** to the SOC lead (me 😎) with full details.

This became my first **end-to-end automated threat response loop** — detection → enrichment → notification → action.

---

## 🪟 Phase 5: Adding the Windows Detection Layer via ELK
To make the environment more realistic, I integrated a **Windows Server** into the SOC — not just as a log source, but as an intelligent detection node.

Here’s how it worked:
1.  The **Elastic Agent** on the Windows instance shipped event logs (like login attempts) to **Elastic Cloud**.
2.  Inside **Kibana**, I created **custom correlation rules** — for example:
    * “Trigger an alert if there are 5 consecutive SSH login failures within 1 minute.”

When the rule fired, **Elasticsearch sent a webhook** directly to **Shuffle SOAR**.
Shuffle then:
* Performed a **VirusTotal check** on the source IP.
* Compiled the results into an **automated incident report**.
* Sent a detailed **email alert** to the SOC team lead with the attacker’s IP reputation and event timeline.

This added an entire new dimension — now both **Linux and Windows** hosts were actively contributing to detection, correlation, and automated response.

It made my SOC feel closer to a **real-world, hybrid enterprise environment**.

```



Once the architecture was complete, I validated the setup through **controlled attack simulations**:
* **Hydra** for SSH brute force and DVWA login.

Each attack was tracked end-to-end — Suricata detected it, Wazuh correlated it, and AWS Lambda auto-blocked the attacker’s IP while Shuffle alerted me instantly.

That’s when the SOC came alive — seeing alerts fire, automation kick in, and defences respond was like watching a digital battlefield unfold. ⚔️

## 🎥 See it in Action
Watch the SOC project live in action on YouTube:

* **YouTube Video (Windows):** [https://youtu.be/7rIzMLEmPbA](https://youtu.be/7rIzMLEmPbA)
* **YouTube Video (Linux):** [https://youtu.be/_K8RWR_9hto](https://youtu.be/_K8RWR_9hto)

These videos demonstrate how traffic flows through the system, how alerts are generated, and how automated responses block attacks in real-time.

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned
* **Correlation is king** — A single log is meaningless until you connect it with others.
* **Automation saves time** — SOAR platforms like Shuffle make response lightning-fast.
* **Visibility matters** — Suricata + Wazuh + Elastic is a powerful combo for full visibility.
* **Real attacks teach better than theory** — Simulating brute force, web attacks, and scans made me truly understand detection logic.

---

## 🚀 What’s Next
This was just the beginning. My next steps are:
* Integrating **EDR (like CrowdStrike or Velociraptor)** for deeper endpoint visibility.
* Adding **Threat Intelligence feeds** into Wazuh correlation rules.
* Building **custom dashboards** in Kibana for attacker profiling.
* Reduce the amount of **False Positives** in the environment.

Ultimately, I want this to evolve into a **fully autonomous SOC lab** — one that detects, decides, and defends on its own.

---

## 💭 Final Thoughts
Building this SOC from scratch taught me more than months of theoretical learning ever could.

It’s not just about setting up tools — it’s about **understanding how defenders think**, how data moves, and how automation can give you the upper hand in cybersecurity.

If you’re a learner like me, don’t wait for a “perfect lab setup.”
* Start small.
* Break things.
* Connect systems.
* And most importantly, **learn from the alerts you trigger.**

That’s how you turn from a student… into a real SOC analyst. 🕵️‍♂️
